# **Privacy Policy for FREN**

**Last Updated:** August 22, 2025

Hey there\! We wrote this to explain in the clearest way possible what information FREN collects, why we collect it, and how we handle it. Your privacy is super important to us.

### **The Golden Rule**

Our golden rule is to collect the **absolute minimum** amount of data necessary for FREN to work. We don't want your personal information, and we have no interest in selling your data to anyone. That's a promise.

### **What Data We Actually Collect**

When you add FREN to your Discord server and use its commands, we may store and use the following information:

* **Discord IDs (Server, User, Channel):**  
  * **Server ID:** To manage server-specific settings.  
  * **User ID:** To link data like reminders, economy balances, and premium status to the correct user.  
  * **Channel ID:** To know where to send messages like reminders and welcome announcements.  
* **Server Settings:**  
  * We store server-specific configurations, such as custom prefixes or the channel designated for welcome messages.  
* **User-Provided Content & Command Data:**  
  * **Reminders:** We store the content of your reminders (text, time, and any GIF links you provide) so we can deliver them correctly.  
  * **Ping Tracking:** We store User IDs involved in a ping and a timestamp to track who has pinged whom.  
  * **AI Study Buddy:** We process the questions and prompts you send to the AI to generate a response. We may temporarily log conversations to improve the service, but we do not link them to your User ID long-term.  
  * **Economy Data (Future):** For the upcoming economy system, we will store your User ID along with your virtual balance and inventory.  
  * **Premium Status:** We store your User ID to confirm your access to premium features.

### **What We Absolutely DON'T Collect**

We will **never** knowingly collect or store sensitive personal information that is not essential for the bot's function. This includes:

* Your email address  
* Your password  
* Your real name  
* Your IP address  
* Your message content outside of direct commands to FREN.

### **Why We Need This Data**

Simply put, FREN wouldn't work without this data. We need IDs to save settings for the right server, link reminders to the right user, and ensure the AI responds in the correct channel. This data is used **exclusively** to provide and improve FREN's features.

### **How We Store Your Data**

The data we collect is stored in a secure database. We take all reasonable technical measures to protect it from unauthorized access. We only keep your data for as long as it's needed for FREN to function or as long as the bot remains in your server.

### **Your Rights & How to Delete Your Data**

You have the right to your data. If you want your information removed from our database, you can:

1. **Kick FREN from your server.** This will automatically trigger the deletion of all data associated with that server.  
2. **Contact us directly.** Join our [**Support Server on Discord**](https://discord.gg/uCBqzxPps7) or DM **zing\_.13**, and we will manually remove any data associated with your User ID.

### **Questions?**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data, please don't hesitate to reach out to us in our support server.

Thanks for trusting FREN\! üêæ
