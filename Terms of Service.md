Terms of Service for FREN
Last Updated: August 22, 2025

Welcome to FREN! We're so excited to have you. By inviting and using FREN in your Discord server, you agree to these simple and fair rules. Think of this as the friendly, pawsitive agreement between you and our bot.

1. The Basic Rules (User Conduct)
Follow Discord's Rules: First and foremost, you must always follow Discord's own Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. FREN is a guest in Discord's house, so we all have to respect their rules.

Use FREN Responsibly: You agree not to use FREN to engage in any activity that is harmful, illegal, harassing, or abusive. This includes, but is not limited to:

Spamming commands.

Automating commands in a way that disrupts the service.

Attempting to exploit any bugs in the economy system (when released).

Using the AI features to generate hateful or inappropriate content.

No Funny Business: You may not attempt to exploit, reverse-engineer, decompile, or gain unauthorized access to our bot or its systems. Please let FREN do its job.

2. Bot Features & Services
FREN offers a mix of free and premium services to make your server more fun and productive.

Core Services: Features like reminders, ping tracking, and the AI Study Buddy are provided for free.

Premium Services: Certain features, such as enhanced AI "talk" personalities and custom "meme" generators, require an active subscription to access.

Economy System: FREN may include an economy system with virtual currency and items. This currency has no real-world value and cannot be exchanged for real money. We reserve the right to change, reset, or remove economy data at any time.

3. User-Generated Content (UGC)
You are responsible for the content you provide to FREN.

Your Content: You may be able to upload your own content, such as GIFs for reminders and welcome messages, or configure custom AI personalities. You are solely responsible for this content and for ensuring you have the rights to use it.

Prohibited Content: You may not upload or use any content that is illegal, pornographic, hateful, excessively violent, or infringes on anyone's copyright or intellectual property.

Our Right to Use: By providing content to FREN, you grant us a license to use, display, and distribute that content as necessary for the bot's operation (e.g., showing your custom GIF in a reminder).

Content Removal: We reserve the right to remove any user-generated content that violates these terms, without prior notice.

4. Payments and Subscriptions
Billing: Access to Premium Services is provided on a subscription basis. All payments are processed through Discord's official platform or a secure third-party payment provider.

Refund Policy: Payments for subscriptions are for digital goods and are non-refundable. You may cancel your subscription at any time, and you will retain access to premium features until the end of your current billing period.

5. Our Promises (Our Responsibilities)
We'll Do Our Best: We will make every reasonable effort to keep FREN running smoothly 24/7. However, outages, bugs, or maintenance can happen, so we cannot guarantee 100% uptime.

We Respect Your Privacy: We are committed to protecting your data. Our data handling practices are detailed in our Privacy Policy. By agreeing to these terms, you also agree to our Privacy Policy.

Things Can Change: We reserve the right to update these terms or change, add, or remove FREN's features at any time. We will do our best to communicate major changes in our support server.

6. The "Uh Oh" Clause (Limitation of Liability)
FREN is provided "as is." We are not liable for any damages or losses that might result from using the bot. For example, we are not responsible if:

A reminder fails to send on time.

The AI Study Buddy provides incorrect or unhelpful information.

There's a bug that causes a loss of data, such as your economy balance or tracked pings.

Another user's custom content (UGC) causes offense or issues.

Please use FREN's features, especially moderation and AI commands, with care.

7. Losing Access to FREN (Termination)
We reserve the right to ban any user or server from using FREN, at our sole discretion and without warning, if they are found to be violating these terms or engaging in abusive behavior.

8. Got Questions?
If you have any questions about these terms, we're happy to help! The best way to reach us is by:

Sending a direct message to zing_.13 on Discord for urgent matters.

Thanks for using FREN and helping us build a purrfectly awesome community! üêæ
